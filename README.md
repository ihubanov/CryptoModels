## 🌟 Key Features

### 🚀 What Makes CryptoModels Different from Ollama & LMStudio

**🌐 TRUE Decentralized Model Storage**
- Unlike Ollama/LMStudio that rely on centralized repositories (Hugging Face, GitHub), CryptoAgents uses **IPFS/Filecoin** for permanent, censorship-resistant model distribution
- Models are stored across a distributed network - **no single point of failure or control**
- Access your models even if traditional platforms go down or restrict access

**🔒 Ultimate Privacy with Local Execution**  
- **100% local inference** - your data never touches external servers (unlike cloud AI services)
- **Zero telemetry** - no usage tracking, no model access logs, no data collection
- **Air-gapped capability** - run models completely offline once downloaded

### 🛠️ Additional Capabilities

- **🏛️ Sovereign Weights**: Maintain complete ownership and control over your AI models
- **🛡️ Zero Trust Privacy**: Your prompts, responses, and model usage remain completely private
- **🔗 OpenAI Compatibility**: Use familiar API endpoints with your existing tools
- **👁️ Multi-Model Support**: Works with both text and vision models
- **⚡ Parallel Processing**: Efficient model compression and upload
- **🔄 Automatic Retries**: Robust error handling for network issues
- **📊 Metadata Management**: Comprehensive model information tracking

### Why Sovereign Weights Matter

In an era of increasing AI centralization, CryptoModels puts you back in control:

- **Own Your Models**: Models are stored on decentralized infrastructure, not controlled by any single entity
- **Private by Design**: All inference happens locally on your hardware - no external API calls, no data collection
- **Censorship Resistant**: Decentralized storage ensures your models remain accessible regardless of platform policies
- **Vendor Independence**: Break free from proprietary AI services and their limitations

eai model run --hash <hash>           # Run a model server
eai model run <model-name>            # Run a preserved model (e.g., qwen3-1.7b)
eai model stop                        # Stop the running model server  
eai model status                      # Check which model is running
eai model download --hash <hash>      # Download a model from IPFS
eai model preserve --folder-path <path>  # Upload/preserve a model to IPFS

# General commands
eai --version                         # Show version information
```

### Command Examples

```bash
# Run a preserved model (user-friendly)
eai model run qwen3-1.7b --port 8080

# Run any model by hash
eai model run --hash bafkreiacd5mwy4a5wkdmvxsk42nsupes5uf4q3dm52k36mvbhgdrez422y --port 8080

## Advanced Usage

### Prerequisites for Model Preservation
1. A model in `gguf` format (compatible with `llama.cpp`)
2. A [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.storage/) account and API key

### Uploading Custom Models

You can use `eai model preserve` to upload your own `gguf` models downloaded from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) for deploying to the CryptoAgents platform.

#### Model Preparation

The platform now supports multiple model types through the `--task` parameter:

##### For Chat Models (Text Generation)

Use `--task chat` for conversational AI and text generation models.

1. **Download the model**:
   - Go to Huggingface and download your desired `.gguf` model
   - Example: Download [`Qwen3-8B-Q8_0.gguf`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF/blob/main/Qwen3-8B-Q8_0.gguf)

2. **Prepare the folder structure**:
   - Create a new folder with a descriptive name (e.g., `qwen3-8b-q8`)
   - Place the downloaded `.gguf` file inside this folder
   - Rename the file to match the folder name, but **remove the `.gguf` extension**

**Example Structure for Chat Models:**
```
qwen3-8b-q8/              # Folder name
└── qwen3-8b-q8          # File name (no .gguf extension)
```

##### For Embedding Models

Use `--task embed` for text embedding and similarity models.

1. **Download the embedding model**:
   - Go to Huggingface and download your desired embedding model in `.gguf` format
   - Example: Text embedding models like [`Qwen3 Embedding 0.6B`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF) or specialized embedding models

2. **Prepare the folder structure**:
   - Create a new folder with a descriptive name (e.g., `qwen3-embedding-0.6b-q8`)
   - Place the downloaded `.gguf` file inside this folder
   - Rename the file to match the folder name, but **remove the `.gguf` extension**

**Example Structure for Embedding Models:**
```
qwen3-embedding-0.6b-q8/         # Folder name
└── qwen3-embedding-0.6b-q8     # File name (no .gguf extension)
```

##### For Vision Models (Image-Text-to-Text)

Use `--task chat` for vision models as they are conversational models with image understanding capabilities.

1. **Download the model files**:
   - Go to Huggingface and download both required files:
     - The main model file (e.g., [`gemma-3-4b-it-q4_0.gguf`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it-qat-q4_0-gguf/blob/main/gemma-3-4b-it-q4_0.gguf))
     - The projector file (e.g., [`mmproj-model-f16-4B.gguf`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-4b-it-qat-q4_0-gguf/blob/main/mmproj-model-f16-4B.gguf))

2. **Prepare the folder structure**:
   - Create a new folder with a descriptive name (e.g., `gemma-3-4b-it-q4`)
   - Place both downloaded files inside this folder
   - Rename the files to match the folder name, but **remove the `.gguf` extension**
   - Add `-projector` suffix to the projector file

**Example Structure for Vision Models:**
```
gemma-3-4b-it-q4/                    # Folder name
├── gemma-3-4b-it-q4                # Main model file (no .gguf extension)
└── gemma-3-4b-it-q4-projector      # Projector file (no .gguf extension)
```

#### Estimating RAM Requirements

Use the [GGUF parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@huggingface/gguf) to estimate RAM usage:

```bash
npx @huggingface/gguf qwen3-8b-q8/qwen3-8b-q8 --context 32768
```

#### Upload Commands

**Basic Upload:**
```bash
export LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key
eai model preserve --folder-path qwen3-8b-q8
```

**Advanced Upload with Metadata:**
```bash
export LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key
eai model preserve \
  --folder-path qwen3-8b-q8 \
  --task chat \
  --ram 12 \
  --hf-repo Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF \
  --hf-file Qwen3-8B-Q8_0.gguf \
  --zip-chunk-size 512 \
  --threads 16 \
  --max-retries 5
```

**Upload for Embedding Models:**
```bash
export LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_api_key
eai model preserve \
  --folder-path qwen3-embedding-0.6b-q8 \
  --task embed \
  --ram 1.16 \
  --hf-repo Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF \
  --hf-file Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-Q8_0.gguf
```

#### Upload Options

| Option | Description | Default | Required |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `--folder-path` | Folder containing the model files | - | ✅ |
| `--task` | Task type: `chat` for text generation models, `embed` for embedding models | `chat` | ❌ |
| `--ram` | RAM usage in GB at 32768 context length | - | ❌ |
| `--hf-repo` | Hugging Face repository (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF`) | - | ❌ |
| `--hf-file` | Original Hugging Face filename | - | ❌ |
| `--zip-chunk-size` | Compression chunk size in MB | 512 | ❌ |
| `--threads` | Number of compression threads | 16 | ❌ |
| `--max-retries` | Maximum upload retry attempts | 5 | ❌ |

#### Upload Process

The upload process involves several steps:

1. **Compression**: The model folder is compressed using `tar` and `pigz` for optimal compression
2. **Chunking**: Large files are split into chunks (default: 512MB) for reliable uploads
3. **Parallel Upload**: Multiple chunks are uploaded simultaneously for faster transfer
4. **Retry Logic**: Failed uploads are automatically retried up to 20 times
5. **Metadata Generation**: A metadata file is created with upload information and model details
6. **IPFS Storage**: All files are stored on IPFS via Lighthouse.storage

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Missing API Key**: Ensure `LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY` is set in your environment
- **Network Issues**: The system will automatically retry failed uploads
- **Insufficient RAM**: Check the model's RAM requirements before uploading
- **Invalid File Format**: Ensure the model is in GGUF format

## 📚 Additional Information

### Model Format
- We support GGUF files compatible with llama.cpp
- Convert other formats using [llama.cpp conversion tools](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)

### Performance Tips
- Choose quantization levels (Q4, Q6, Q8) based on your hardware capabilities
- Higher quantization (Q8) offers better quality but requires more resources
- Lower quantization (Q4) is more efficient but may affect model performance
- Monitor system resources during model operation
- Use appropriate context lengths for your use case

### Security
